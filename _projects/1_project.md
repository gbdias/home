description: Guided case study from Google Data Analytics
---

The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate instructs course takers to complete a guided case study simulating a real world scenario faced by a junior data analyst.

**Scenario**

> You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
