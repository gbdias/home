I am a data analyst with experience in computational biology and genetics based in Brazil. I studied Biomedical Science in college and was immediately drawn to the universal aspects of genetics, which would allow one to study very diverse organisms under the same framework. I then went to grad school and got my Master's and Ph.D. in genetics, with an emphasis on genomics and bioinformatics. 

In 2018 I moved to the USA to work as a postdoctoral research associate at a computational biology lab. There I fell in love with data analysis and had the opportunity to work with large genomics datasets and to learn more about key data analysis skills including Unix tools, R programming, cluster computing, environment management with Anaconda, version control with Git, and more.

After doing genomics data analysis for nearly four years I decided to broaden my analytic skills and re-tool my CV to explore a wider range of opportunities in data analytics. To this end I recently completed the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics){:target="_blank"}.

In my free time I like to read, watch TV shows, and explore the city.
